### Hi, there! ðŸ‘‹
This is my repo for studies about the 42 Exam Rank 02, at [42 SÃ£o Paulo](https://42sp.org.br/)

I bravely encourage you to study with the repo [Pasquale Rossi](https://github.com/pasqualerossi/42-School-Exam-Rank-02)

Please, use the TTA method (Try-Try-Again) for **many days** (or weeks like me)
